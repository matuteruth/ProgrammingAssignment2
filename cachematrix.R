makecacheMatrix <- function(x = numeric()) {      # input x will be a vector

m <- NULL    #  m will be our 'mean' and it's reset to NULL every 
#    time makeVector is called

#  note these next three functions are defined but not run when makeVector is called.
#   instead, they will be used by cachemean() to get values for x or for
#   m (mean) and for setting the mean.  These are usually called object 'methods'

get <- function() {
  x 
}   # this function returns the value of the original vector

setmean <- function(mean)  {
  m <<- mean
}
# this is called by cachemean() during the first cachemean()
#  access and it will store the value using superassignment

getmean <- function() { m } # this will return the cached value to cachemean() on
#  subsequent accesses

list(get = get,          #  OK, this is accessed each time makeVector() is called,       
     setmean = setmean,  #   that is, each time we make a new object.  This is a list of 
     getmean = getmean)  #   the internal functions ('methods') so a calling function
#   knows how to access those methods.
